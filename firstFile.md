### Changing file

I don't add spaces or tabs in this example for Lab2.

On the next paragraph, let's talk about lines. This message is wrote on first line.
And this message I write on the second line.

And this time and in this paragraph I want to **highlight** bold word. Then, after that I want to *highlight* italic word style.

Now I ***highlight*** bold italyc word style, and that's all.
And for checking commiting changes on local PC I try to edit this file and write a few words.
